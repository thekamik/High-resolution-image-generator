An example of using the OpenAI API in python to automate email responses

1. This script was created to automatically generate images using OpenAI API. <br />
   First, we generate the image in the highest possible resolution. <br />
   Then we scale the image to the new resolution.


2. The program is ready to use. You only need: <br />
   a.) Install the OpenAI library:<br />
   ```sh
